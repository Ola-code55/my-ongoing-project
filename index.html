      Singing is the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. A person
      whose profession is singing is called a singer, artist or vocalist (in
      jazz and/or popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives,
      songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical
      instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a
      choir. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a
      single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony
      orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as
      opera and Chinese opera, Indian music, Japanese music, and religious music
      styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues,
      ghazal, and popular music styles such as pop, rock, and electronic dance
      music.
